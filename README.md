# Object Detection Using TensorFlow Hub
This project demonstrates object detection using a pre-trained Faster R-CNN model from TensorFlow Hub. 
It identifies objects in an image, draws bounding boxes around them, and labels them with their class names and detection scores.

# Features
Utilizes the Faster R-CNN model with Inception-ResNet V2 trained on OpenImagesV4.
Draws bounding boxes with dynamic colors for each detected object.
Displays object class names and detection confidence scores.
Supports non-max suppression to filter overlapping boxes.

# Dependencies
Make sure the following libraries are installed:

tensorflow
tensorflow_hub
numpy
opencv-python
matplotlib
